OpenEMS is a free and open source :ref:`EC-FDTD <fdtd>` solver. The development was started in February 2010, and it is written in C++. An extensive scripting interface is used to define the FDTD options. The geometry used for the FDTD simulations is handled by the CSXCAD library, which is part of the openEMS project, and also accessible via scripting.



**********************************
Capabilities
**********************************

With openEMS you can conduct an electromagnetic field simulation of any 3D model, e.g. waveguides, coax lines, microstrips, striplines, inductors, PCBs with passive components (R, L, C, transmission line), patch antennas, horn antennas, helical antennas, and many more. The 3D model can be described in cartesian or cylindrical coordinates.

The results of the simulation can be extracted in time- or frequency domain (e.g. S-parameters), field dumps allow to observe the field components in a 3D animation (using ParaView), NF2FF allows to observe the far field, ...



**********************************
Features
**********************************

* Efficient EC-FDTD method in full 3D cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates or cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z)
* Fully graded mesh
* Multi-threading, SIMD (SSE) and MPI support for high speed parallel FDTD
* Simple engine extensions API to easily introduce new features to the FDTD algorithm
* Matlab/Octave-Interface
* Absorbing boundary conditions (MUR, PML)
* Coordinate dependent material definitions
* Coordinate dependent excitation definitions (e.g. mode-profiles)
* Dispersive materials (Drude/Lorentz/Debye type)
* Field dumps in time and frequency domain, in .vtk or .hdf5 file format
* Flexible post-processing routines (mostly in Matlab/Octave)
* Subgrids to reduce simulation time in cylindrical coordinates
* Remote simulations using SSH (Linux only)

**********************************
Workflow
**********************************

Design Entry
	The geometry as well as the simulation parameters (stimuli, probes, field dumps, ...) are build with scripts, either in Matlab/Octave or in Python; the scripting interface consists of a geometry part for CSXCAD, and a FDTD part for openEMS

Simulation
	Script functions put all design data into a file, which is processed by openEMS; the result data (probe readings, field dumps) are written into files

Result Evaluation
	Back in the scripting environment, the data generated by openEMS is read, processed and plotted, e.g. to retrieve S-parameters or antenna radiation patterns, while field dumps can be visualized and animated with ParaView
